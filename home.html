		   		<img src="images/BlogPics/johnwall.jpg" class="blogPic" alt="John Wall"/><p class="blogParagraph">The kid is back. After setbacks with a lingering injury, John Wall is back with the Wizards 
		   		ready to wreck shop! They start off with a big blow out win and a little more optimism on the struggling Wiz squad.
		   		 I feel like I can now use the Wizards on NBA 2k13 because of Wall's insertion into the line up. I even beat the Lakeshow
		   		 last night in an online quick match. I was shocked...guess who had the game winning dunk with 4 seconds on the clock.
		   		 I could have kissed the screen I was so freaking elated lol. I was on that Pepe Le Peau.</p>

		   		<img src="images/BlogPics/clevelandmap.jpg" class="blogPic" alt="Cleveland"/><p class="blogParagraph">So Joelle and I get into the discussion about what we're looking forward to for this year 
		   		and we have to decide where we want to go travel-wise. I think we have maybe  or four viable options given our limited
		   		budget thus far. I would nominate Cleveland, Canada, Upstate New York, and Los Angeles. Cleveland is in the race because
		   		of Niesha being located there and it's probably less expensive than probably anywhere else. Canada would be fun because
		   		we could make it to a French speaking area to practice our burgeoning second language. Upstate New York might be fun
		   		because I have family there and I rarely get to see what the rest of New York looks like. It can get quite suburban/ rural
		   		in some places. Lastly, Los Angeles would be fun because it's probably a little warmer and we have family and friends in
		   		that section of the country that it would be great to see in their own backyards. There are some other options but those are tops in my
		   		book. We'll keep you all up to date on our most latest travels.</p>

		   		<img src="images/BlogPics/goldenglobes.jpg" class="blogPic" alt="Golden Globes"/><p class="blogParagraph">So Joelle and I were watchingg the Golden Globes and just cracking up at all the
		   		hollywood ballyhoo. Tina Fey and Amy Poehler killed it which I was banking on. I saw Argo
		   		and agree that it was a solid film. I just think that it came out too early to get that strong
		   		push for an uncontested Oscar win. We'll see. I gotta say that I enjoyed Jodie Foster's speech but
		   		was heavily distracted by the Mel Gibson sighting and instantly went to youtube to relive his whole
		   		recorded phone call debacle that had knocked him down a peg in the public eye. It's hilarious 
		   		listening to it again! If you don't have issue with coarse obscenity filled rage then have a listen.
		   		Also, if you haven't seen it, go watch "The Beaver".</p>

		   		<img src="images/BlogPics/newyears.jpg" class="blogPic" alt="New Years"/><p class="blogParagraph">
		   		Joelle and I made it in good time for a nice little party in Long Island that we normally attend for the new year. 
		   		Her parent's managed to throw together some food and invited all the family over to partake in eachother's company. 
		   		Phillipe came with his lady friend and we all awaited the countdown together. We missed having Michael there 
		   		with us but I know he was having fun wherever he decided to bring in the new year.</p>
