		Joelle and John wanted to put together a website that would act as a small window into the places and things that they enjoy
		and love. It's a fun project that hopefully will grow and expand over time. Below are simple profiles for John and Joelle:<br /><br /><br />
		
		<img class="profilePhoto" src="images/people_photos/john100_125.jpg" width="100px" height="125px" alt="john portrait">John lives to enjoy the little pleasures of life whether it's crushing the competition in NBA 2k13 online or baking a delicious apple pie from scratch.
		He has a creative background having grown up on comicbooks and drawing the superheroes and heroines that he would read about. Transforming that love
		for the pencil drawing to the Adobe Creative Suite and the print and web format, John became a professional graphic designer. Originally from
		Hyattsville, Maryland John moved to Brooklyn, New York to pursue his career in the media capital of the world... the Big Apple. He  hopes to thrive in
		his chosen profession and expand his skillset. John currently is pursuing freelance opportunities and enjoying the fruits of his labor.<br /><br /><br />
		
		
		<img class="profilePhoto" src="images/people_photos/joelle100_125.jpg" width="100px" height="125px" alt="joelle portrait">Joelle is an easygoing young woman who split her formative years first in Brooklyn and then in the town of Valleystream in Long Island. 
		She enjoys the 80's in general...whether it's music, fashion, cinema, or other remnants of that bygone era, Joelle loves it all. She likes great movies
		that are critically acclaimed and can easily identify with other cultural experiences. That means she likes foreign flicks ::chuckles::. Joelle was exposed
		to a few of the arts growing up such as piano and dance and carried her love of the creative fields to college. She studied architecture and went through
		an intense 5-year program in which she finished back in 2008. Now she works with a well-known tile and marble company and is currently trying to pick up a 
		few hobbies such as speaking french and sewing.
